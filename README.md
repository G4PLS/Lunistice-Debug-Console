# Debug Console
With the Debug Console you can change A LOT of game values and even teleport to set positions!

### For this you have 4 different tabs:
- Game: Change values like the Time Scale or the Gravity
- Level: Skip Levels or go directly to levels
- Player: Change quite a bit of player values like the speed, jump height, lifes and more
- Teleport: Create and delete teleport Points

### You have multiple key-bindings that got added for the Debug Console:
- **C**: Open/Close the Debug Console
- **R**: Restart a Level
- **T**: Create a Teleport Point
- **G**: Teleport to the last created Point
